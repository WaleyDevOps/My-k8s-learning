# My-k8s-learning:

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better at understading Kubernetes. I will be updating the reposrtory regularly with Labs.

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

Kubernetes provides highly resilient infrastructure with zero downtime deployment capabilities, automatic rollback, scaling, and self-healing of containers (which consists of auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication, and scaling of containers on the basis of CPU usage).
Kubernetes created from Borg & Omega projects by google as they use it to orchestrate they data center since 2003.
Google open-sourced kubernetes at 2014

What is Orchestration Do?
1. Configuring and scheduling of containers.
2. Provisioning and deployments of containers.
3. High Availability of containers.
4. Configuration of the applications that run in containers.
5. Scaling of containers to equally balance the application workloads across infrastructure.
6. Location of HW resources between containers.
7. Add balancing, traffic routing and service discovery of containers.
8. Health monitoring of containers.
9. Securing the interactions between containers and more many.
