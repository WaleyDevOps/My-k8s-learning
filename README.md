This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better at understading Kubernetes. I will be updating the reposrtory regularly with Labs.

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

Kubernetes provides highly resilient infrastructure with zero downtime deployment capabilities, automatic rollback, scaling, and self-healing of containers (which consists of auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication, and scaling of containers on the basis of CPU usage).
Kubernetes created from Borg & Omega projects by google as they use it to orchestrate they data center since 2003.
Google open-sourced kubernetes at 2014
